Assignment 1 : Error Detection using Cyclic Redundancy Code (Using CRC-8) 

Group No. : 18

Step To Run :

1. Compile server.c and client.c with crc.c in CRC directory.
   gcc server.c CRC/crc.c -o server
   gcc client.c CRC/crc.c -o client

2. Prototypes to run programs-
   Server: <executable code> <Server Port number> 
   ./server PORT_NO
   Client: <executable code> <Server IP Address> <Server Port number> 
   ./client IP PORT_NO

3. The server spawns a thread for each client request and does blocking read.

4. For each iteration a random binary string is generated by the client. Based on the BER set, error is introduced in the packet and transmitted to the server.

5. The thread serving the client at the server end reads the packet and performs CRC check on the same. 

6. Based on the packet loss rate set, server simulates packet loss (No ACK/NACK is sent).

7. If the message passes CRC check (remainder 0) ACK is sent, else NACK is sent.

8. Client retransmits the packet if NACK is received or if timeout occurs due to packet loss. If ACK is received, it proceeds to the next iteration.

9. The server terminates gracefully if CTRL-C is pressed.
